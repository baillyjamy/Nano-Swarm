# Nano Swarm


You are a swarm of nanobots. Sadly you are not the only one. Enemy swarms will come in waves and try to populate the screen. Destroy them with your brutes at close range, your long ranged nanobots, or even your suicidal nanobots! You also dispose of workers to rebuild your swarm from the leftover wrecks of war, try to survive as long as possible! 

## Usage
1. Clone the project
2. Install [GLFW] (http://www.glfw.org/) and [SFML] (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library
3. Open the project directory
4. `make` the project
5. Launch the game: `./nano-swarm`

## Controls
The game is controlled with mouse and keyboard. Use the left click to drag select and the right click to move. Press 1, 2, 3, 4 keys to narrow down the selection to workers, brutes, shooters and bombers respectivelly.
You can also select all our bots with spacebar. Have fun!
